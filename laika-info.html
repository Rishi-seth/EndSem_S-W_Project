            <h2>Who Was Laika?</h2>
            <p>Laika was a stray dog from the streets of Moscow, selected by Soviet scientists for her resilience and small size to become the first living being to orbit Earth.</p>

            <h2>Mission: Sputnik 2</h2>
            <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> November 3, 1957</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To test the effects of space travel on a living organism and gather data for future human missions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section" data-animate="fade-in">
            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>Laika underwent rigorous training, including confinement in small spaces, exposure to loud noises, and simulated zero-gravity conditions. Her calm temperament made her ideal for the mission.</p>

        <div class="content-section" data-animate="fade-in">
            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>Sputnik 2, hastily designed after the success of Sputnik 1, lacked a recovery system. Laika was sent on a one-way mission, orbiting Earth in a capsule equipped with life-support systems (oxygen, food in gel form).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section" data-animate="fade-in">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>Laika died a few hours into the mission due to overheating caused by a technical malfunction. Sputnik 2 continued orbiting Earth for 162 days before burning up upon reentry on April 14, 1958.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section" data-animate="fade-in">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Laikaâ€™s mission was a milestone in space exploration, paving the way for human spaceflight. Although her sacrifice sparked ethical debates, she remains a symbol of the courage and cost of exploration.</p>
